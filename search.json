    "text": "On July 15th, 1975, two spacecraft rendezvoused in low Earth orbit, completing the first of many handshakes symbolizing a new, though short lived, era of cooperation between the United States and Soviet Union. This is the story of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP), and the ways people responded to the ASTP through the media. Reports, editorials, op-eds, and political cartoons all were used to represent the various opinions people had about the project and the space program at large.\n\n\n\nASTP Crews, credit: NASA\n\n\nWhile this mission was a scripted, dramatic affair meant to demonstrate to the world that the US and USSR had buried the metaphorical hatchet and would begin working together in space, to others it signaled, as much of the space program already had, that the US government was more than willing to spend taxpayer money on grandiose displays while Americans suffered through an era of economic uncertainty and instability.\nThese Americans would take to the press to voice their concerns. Americans from all walks of life, and from all across the country, took issue with the ASTP at some level. Some viewed the project as wasteful, while others viewed it as yet another mission in a line of wasteful government spending.\n\n\n\nThe Palm Beach Post, 7/13/1975\n\n\nThis article out of the Palm Beach Post summarizes the main talking points best. On one side, the economic state of the United States left many wondering why money was spent on this project. On the other side, this mission allowed for a very public display of cooperation between the two countries, which meant greater levels of communication and sharing resources. Cooperation means that cost for the mission is split between those participating in it, bringing the economic burden on any one specific participating nation down considerably over time."

It showcases the ways in which the media reported on and published materials relating to public perceptions of the space program.\nIt is maintained by Bailey Evans, a second year history master’s student at Virginia Tech. His research focuses on international cooperation in space between the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War and public perceptions of this cooperation on both sides of the Iron Curtain."
